## Background of single image training technique for GAN and related research
Texture Expansion
(Zhou, Y., Zhu, Z., Bai, X., Lischinski, D., Cohen-Or, D., & Huang, H. (2018). Non-Stationary Texture Synthesis by Adversarial Expansion. ArXiv:1805.04487 [Cs]. https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04487)

Training GAN with single image already come into play for a while. 
In 2018, there’s a research about texture expansion. It relies on single texture image, and achieve high quality picture expansion by generating more texture to fill up the image. 

InGAN-Internal GAN
(Shocher, A., Bagon, S., Isola, P., & Irani, M. (n.d.). InGAN: Capturing and Retargeting the “DNA” of a Natural Image. Retrieved August 10, 2022, from https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Shocher_InGAN_Capturing_and_Retargeting_the_DNA_of_a_Natural_Image_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf)
By 2019, there’s another research which based on single natural image and achieve retargeting. Retargeting at here can be understand by two aspects, the first parts is expanding, the second part is shrinking. Both action should not tilt, scale or change the major target in the image. A good example you can see here, the input is a picture with three birds in it, and on the right hand side, when we we change the width of the image, instead of squiz the picture, the output from InGAN just put three birds moves closer to each other. 

SinGAN
(Shaham, T., Dekel, T., Research, G., & Michaeli, T. (n.d.). SinGAN: Learning a Generative Model from a Single Natural Image. Retrieved August 10, 2022, from https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Shaham_SinGAN_Learning_a_Generative_Model_From_a_Single_Natural_Image_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf)
At 2019 we have a better solution, SinGAN. Why it’s better? First SinGAN is unconditional veras InGAN is conditional. Secondly application wise, SinGAN can also achieve highper resolution, harmonization. We can also create animation from single image. 
We show that the internal statistics of patches within a single natural image typically carry enough information for learning a powerful generative model. Once trained, SinGAN can produce diverse high quality image samples (of arbitrary dimensions), which semantically resemble the training image, yet contain new object configurations and structures. 

## Idea of SinGAN Reiteration
The architecture of SinGAN is a pyramid of fully convolutional GANS, each capture the distribution of patches at a different scale of an image. When training a model, the image is downsampled at each scale. The generation of an image starts at the coarsest scale and passes through generators up to the finest scale, with noise injected at every scale. The receptive field of each generator and discriminator is the same, so smaller size of structure is captured as the generation process goes up. In many of our training examples, we try to generate image starting at different scales after training the original target images. At the coarsest scale, generated images have large variation with the original image; at finer scale, SinGAN only modifies details, like textures of the sky or stipes on the zebras. 


## Our Work

In this project, we trained around 40 images in total. The images are images provided by the author, BSD100 dataset, and from our own photos (all in output folder). For many images, we try to further present the same images generated at different scales for comparison (all in output - RandomSamples folder). We also show several examples for each application (all in folders below output). Moreover, we try to adjust four hyperparameters to SinGAN model: pyramid scale factor, reconstruction loss weight, number of layers, and number of epochs to train per scale. The first two hyperparameters investigate the effect of changes on quality of generated images. The last two hyperparameters decide the training speed of the model and see if training faster still produces images of the same quality. We try these changes of hyperparameters on two images: Starry Night and zebra. Starry Night is art work, so probably any modification is allowed; in comparison, zebra is an image of real life so it has to look real, otherwise the generated image is a failure. We want to compare if art work and real-life image require different hyperparameters so that we can have 2 models to train them differently in future.

To evaluate the effect of different hyperparameters and make conclusion, we have 3 difficulties:

1.	Evaluation is quite subjective. Someone in our group has different opinion on realness and fakeness of two sets of images generated by different hyperparameters. Also, is absolute different from the original input or similar from the original input image better if they look both real? The answer depends on individuals.
2.	As said before, if we generate images at coarse scale, the generated image has great variability in global structures, while generate at finer scale only changes finer details. Therefore, if we change one parameter, like reconstruction loss weight, and compare, we may find that the image generated at smaller weight but at lower scale may have the similar distribution than the image generated at larger weight but higher scale. We cannot distinguish which reconstruction loss weight is better at this case.
3.	Each training model would gives us 50 random samples. To almost all the parameters, there are good examples or bad examples. If we only compare the best example generated by different parameters, they are likely to be awesome. Therefore, it is hard to say which parameter is better.

Therefore, in our following analysis, we would emphasize the difference of parameters. Even if we evaluate which parameter is better, it will still be our subjective opinion.
 
### Changed parameter1 - Scale Factor
The model was trained with scale factors of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 (default), and 0.85 with the following command.
```
python main_train.py --scale_factor <scale factor> --input_name <input file name> 
``` 
Two images, zebra.png and starry_night.png, were tested. In both cases, the models trained with a scale factor of 0.25 captured finer details in the original images, but not their global structures. As scale factor increases, the models were able to better capture the global structures of the input images.


### Changed parameter2 - Reconstruction Loss weight
The model was trained with weight 5, 10 (default), and 20 with the following command. 
```
python main_train.py –-alpha <weight> --input_name <input_file_name>
```
Reconstruction loss ensures a specific set of noise maps as input. It also determines the standard deviation in each scale. It gives an indication of the number of details needed to add in that scale. 

### Changed parameter3 - Number of Layers
The model was trained with 4, 5 (default), and 6 layers with the following command. 
```
python main_train.py --num_layer <number of layers> --input_name <input file name> 
``` 
Two images, zebra.png and starry_night.png, were tested. In both cases, the models trained with 4 layers captured the distribution of the input images poorly. The models with 5 layers were sufficient to capture the distribution of the original images. The models with 6 layers produced random samples that were nearly identical to the original images with only minor differences.


### Changed parameter4 - Number of Epoches to Train Per Scale
The images were trained with 1200, 1600, and 2000 epoches with the following command.
```
python main_train.py –-niter <number of epoches> --input_name <input file name>
```
Fewer number of epoches to train lowers time with estimable amount: changing from 2000 to 1200 saves 2/5 amount of time. At small number of epoches like 1200, the image is coarser than 1600 and 2000. At generation scale 0, for Starry Night, there is more variation on the sky with global structure unchanged, so we think 1200 is a good number of epoches that saves time for art work. However, for zebra, both 1200 and 1600 epoches lead to more problem than 2000 epoches. Besides producing more than 4 legs which is a common problem for 2000 epoches, the body of the zebra is often fractured; even at scale 1, there are green color on zebra’s body at 1200 and 1600 epoches, which is very fake. Therefore, we think for real-life image, it is better to keep epoches at 2000.
